      <p>
	Throughout all of the courses in my degree program, there are a lot of things that I have learned and improved on and have been introduced to a wide variety of topics such as databases, software development and engineering, artificial intelligence, data structures and algorithms, 3D computer graphics, operating systems, secure coding, and reverse engineering. All of these have helped me become more well-rounded in computer science and have helped further develop important skills like problem solving, critical thinking, and technical knowledge. Developing projects such as machine learning models and simple CLI games has shaped what I know about the capabilities of software development and how it can bring great importance to the world. I also learned about the importance of having good communication with the team you're working with, project managers, and stakeholders. Doing so allows the company that you work for to save time and money by potentially detecting errors and bugs early in the development process.

	This artifact demonstrates my abilities to envision and create a solution to create a tool that utilizes good software design and engineering practices, uses appropriate data structures and algorithms, and communicates with an SQLite database.

	Here is a list of projects that I have completed:
